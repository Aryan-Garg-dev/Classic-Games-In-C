**Tetris in C: (CLI)**

This C program implements the classic game Tetris in a console interface. Here's a concise overview:

   - Follows standard Tetris rules: pieces fall from the top, players rotate and move them to create solid rows.
   - Completed rows clear, earning points.

2. **Structure**:
   - Uses structs to track piece positions and rotations.
   - Piece shapes defined as character arrays, game board as a 2D array.

3. **Functionality**:
   - Initializes with a random piece falling.
   - Players control with keyboard inputs: rotate (W/w), left (A/a), right (D/d), down (S/s).
   - Ends when pieces reach the top of the screen.

4. **Compilation and Execution**:
   - Compiles with any C compiler supporting standard libraries.
   - Windows requires `conio.h` and `windows.h` for input and console manipulation.
   - Unix-like systems may need adjustments.
